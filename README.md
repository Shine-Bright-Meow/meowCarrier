> [!IMPORTANT]
> Purchase 30% more boards (WeMos D1 Mini, TP4056, and BMI160/LSM6DSR/BNO085 than what is needed. There is the possibility that components are dead on arrival or get damaged during assembly or soldering.

> [!NOTE]
> One order of Resistors, Diodes, Header Pins, and Switches is enough for the entire project.

> [!NOTE]
> The SlimeVR DIY Community recommends buying boards from the following sellers on AliExpress: Win Win, Aitexm, or Tenstar Robot.

> [!NOTE]
> Type-C Ports are more durable. As for charging, USB-C to USB-C Power Delivery doesn't work. Use USB-A to USB-C cables to charge trackers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When purchasing components, some have multiple variants on the same product page, like Diodes and Resistor. Be sure to select the correct one.

| -------------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Trilancer Elastic Cinch Straps | See note below | <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099RNRT7Z> |
| GoPro Chest Mount Harness | See note below | <https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256805774922789.html> |
| GoPro Chest Mount Harness (Chesty) | Option B (with the thumb screw) | <https://www.aliexpress.us/item/2251832640172299.html> |

> [!NOTE]
> 12 inches work for ankles. 18 inches for thinner thighs and 24 inches for thicker thighs. Chest (if not using the GoPro Chest Harness) and Hips can be done by doubling up on 18- or 24-inch straps. Choose what you need for your body and how many trackers you are planning to make. A 3-size combo and either an 18- or 24-inch package would be a start.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two types of GoPro Chest Mount Harness. If the intended user of the trackers has a larger chest, it is recommended to get the "Chesty" harness for comfort. One that clips in, and the other one is fastened by a bolt. Be sure to print the correct GoPro Adapter case.

## Soldering/Assembly Guide

### Written Guide

> [!WARNING]
> Please work in a well-ventilated area. It is recommended to use a fume extractor if working indoors. If you do not have one, use a fan to blow fumes or smoke away from your face.

> [!WARNING]
> It is recommended to use eye production. Especially when splitting header pins apart with a cutter and when trimming down header pins and ends of resistors and diodes.

> [!WARNING]
> If working with leaded solder, be sure to wash your hands when you are done, including under your fingernails. Wipe down and vacuum the floors and surfaces of your workspace and anything you may have cross-contaminated.

> [!TIP]
> Using external flux (preferably Rosin) will allow the solder to flow automatically flow into the correct area.

> [!TIP]
> A wooden clothespin can be used to hold the boards together while soldering.

##### Diodes

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Diodes.png">

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the diode is facing the correct direction and has the correct values.

1. Verify that the diodes are 1N5817. You can find the text in the body.

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Diode1.png">

2. Place the diode's striped (grey or silver) on the narrow stripe indicated on the silkscreen.

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Diode2.png">

3. Bend the ends in 90 degrees so they are shaped like a staple and place them into the through-hole.
4. Pull the excess on the back until the diode is flush with the PCB.
5. Solder ends from the back.
6. Repeat for the other diode.
7. Trim the excess length of the pins using a flush cutter. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter, and cut as close to the PCB as you can.

##### Resistor

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Resistor.png">

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure the resistor has the correct value.

1. Verify the resistor is 180K. The first four colors should go in this order:
- Brown
- Grey
- Black
- Orange

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Resistor2.png">

2. Bend the ends in 90 degrees so they are shaped like a staple and place them into the through-hole. Resistors are not polarized, so the direction does not matter.
3. Pull the excess on the back until the resistor is flush with the PCB.
4. Trim the excess length of the pins using a flush cutter. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter, and cut as close to the PCB as you can.

> [!NOTE]
> Unlike Diodes, Resistors can go into the PCB in any direction.

#### Charging Board (TP4056)

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/TP4056.png">

1. Break the header into individual pins.
2. Place individual pins into the through-holes.
3. Place the TP4056 on top of the header pins to sandwich them in place.
4. If needed, use a clamp, like a wooden clothespin, to hold everything in place.
5. Solder the pins to the back of the PCB.
6. Remove the TP4056 from the PCB and header pins.
7. Using a plier, carefully remove the black plastic spacer from the header pins.
8. Replace the TP4056 back through the Header pins.
9. Solder the header pins and top side of the TP4056.
10. Trim the excess length of pins using a flush cutter on the back side of the PCB and the top side of the TP4056. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter, and cut as close to the PCB as you can.

#### IMU (BMI160, LSM6DSR, or BNO085)

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/IMU.png">

1. If using SlimeVR's BNO085, Meia's LSM6DSR, or another IMU that does not come with header pins, break a row of header pins with the same amount of through-holes as the IMU breakout board.
2. Place the header pins in the corresponding through-holes of the PCB.
3. Solder the pins to the back of the PCB.
4. Solder the header pins and top side of the IMU.
5. Trim the excess length of pins using a flush cutter on the back side of the PCB and the top side of the IMU. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter, and cut as close to the PCB as you can.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using SlimeVR BNO085, you do not need to solder the side with less pins, since the header pins will not fit.

#### MCU (WeMos D1 Mini)

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/MCU.png">

1. Flash the D1 Mini with WiFi credentials to ensure the board is in working condition first.
2. Place both rows of header pins into the through-holes of the PCB.
3. Place D1 Mini on top of the header pins to sandwich them in place.
4. If needed, use a clamp, like a wooden clothespin, to hold everything in place.
5. Solder the pins to the back of the PCB.
6. Solder the header pins and top side of the D1 Mini.
7. Trim the excess length of pins using a flush cutter on the back side of the PCB and top side of the D1 Mini. Use your wire cutter if you don't have a flush cutter, and cut as close to the PCB as you can.

#### Switch

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Switch.png">

1. Place the Switch into the through-holes of the PCB.
2. Solder the 3 pins and the 2 supports on the back of the PCB.
3. Trim the excess length of pins and supports using a flush cutter on the back side of the PCB.

#### Extension Cable/Wire

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Case.png">

1. Put the cable or wire through the hole on your main or AUX case.
2. Take your PCB outside of the case with the wires.
3. If using a cable, cut the jacket to expose the wires inside.
4. Strip the wires to the length of the solder pads for the extensions.
5. Tin the pads by heating them up and applying solder.
6. Place the exposed copper area of the wire on the tin pads and reheat.
7. Match 3V3, GND, SDA, SCL, and INT (INT is only for BNO085) wire colors on your Main and AUX trackers.
8. Verify both trackers are working before hotgluing the outside hole of the case to ensure the cable or wire doesn't get pulled out. (This is the last step after the complete tracker is assembled.).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not solder anything inside the main or AUX case! Pull the extension cable or wire outside of the case with the board before soldering.

#### Battery

<img src="Resources/Images/Assembly/Battery.png">

1. Strip the wires to the length of the solder pads for the battery.
2. Tin the pads by heating them up and applying solder.
3. Place the exposed copper area of the wire on the tin pads and reheat.
4. Match the Red wire with the + side and the Black wire with the - side.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not let the exposed battery leads make contact with each other.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To prevent shorting the PCB or other components, this is the last step in completing the assembly of your tracker. (Right before hotgluing the extension cable or wire to the outside hole of the cases.)

## 3D Printable Case and Accessories Guide
The main case consists of 3 files: Case, Lid, and Tray.

Printer Settings used:
- **Printer:** Creality CR-10 S5
- **Infill:** 100%
- **No** Rafts or Supports
- **Resolution:** 0.2mm
- **Nozzle:** 0.4mm
- Tested with PLA+ and PETG

> [!TIP]
> For stronger strap loops, print the base/bottom 4mm layers with 0% (solid) infill for just the **case** file. Printing with a zig-zap pattern instead of a line will help prevent strap loops from breaking at the weak point where layers join horizontally or vertically. These are done in your Slicer.
